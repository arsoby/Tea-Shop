# Tea-Shop
## This project is part of project in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecadmey</a> "Front-End-Engineer Career Path". 
### I focus to apply the design and ignore the errors in the design - like the copyright sentence within footer -
### Also, I try to make the website acceptable by semantic HTML without adding new element to the design
